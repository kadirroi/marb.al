Hence, for every WebGL application, the basic program flow would be similar to the following:

    Create the WebGL context
    Load, compile, link, and attach shaders
    Initialize vertex buffers and index buffers
    Apply transform and associate buffer objects to shader attributes
    Call the drawArrays or drawElements functions
